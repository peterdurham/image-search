## Idea

Create new creative connections by simply inputting an image into a website and getting a passage of text, or poem that reflects that image. 

Useful for:

* Trying to find some fresh inspiration
* Thinking of clever things to say at parties
* Understanding the real meaning of a parkbench

This seemed like a fun way to test out some cool APIs and work together on a project. Enjoy!
